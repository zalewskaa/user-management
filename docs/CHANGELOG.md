- ❌ `.vb5x8w` - Unused striped component class
- ❌ `.yt9k4m` - Unused clipped polygon component class
- ❌ `.wq2n7p` - Unused radial gradient component class

### Changed

- **Code Formatting**: All JavaScript and CSS files reformatted with Prettier
- **Import Optimization**: Removed unused `moment` import from analytics.js
- **Bundle Size**: Significantly reduced bundle size through dead code elimination

### Performance Impact

#### File Size Reductions

| File            | Before             | After    | Reduction            |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------------------- |
| `utilities.css` | 826 lines          | 41 lines | 95%                  |
| `analytics.js`  | ~100 lines removed | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `charts.js`     | ~60 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `components.js` | ~20 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `utils.js`      | ~30 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `main.js`       | ~25 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |

#### Performance Benefits

- **Reduced JavaScript Bundle Size**: Smaller bundles mean faster parsing and compilation
- **Reduced CSS Bundle Size**: Faster download and parsing times
- **Lower Memory Usage**: No unused function objects or style definitions in memory
- **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with only active code
- **Better Tree Shaking**: Easier for bundlers to identify and eliminate dead code

### Technical Details

#### Prettier Configuration

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

#### Cleanup Methodology

1. **Dead Code Analysis**: Searched for function calls and class usage across the entire codebase
2. **Import Optimization**: Verified all imports are actually used
3. **CSS Usage Verification**: Checked HTML and JavaScript for class references
4. **Conservative Approach**: Only removed code that was definitively unused
5. **Functionality Preservation**: Ensured all working features remain intact

### Notes

- All application functionality has been preserved
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Code cleanup focused on performance optimization through dead code elimination
- All changes are backwards compatible
