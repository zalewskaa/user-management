### Changed

- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed 7 unused dependencies from package.json
- **Script Optimization**: Replaced all CDN imports with npm package bundling via Vite
- **Network Optimization**: Eliminated all external CDN dependency requests
- **Build Optimization**: All dependencies now bundled and optimized by Vite
- **Native JavaScript**: Replaced lodash with native JavaScript utilities for better performance
- **Native Fetch API**: Replaced axios with native Fetch API for HTTP requests

### Performance Impact

#### Dependency Reductions

| Removed Dependencies   | Size Impact           | Network Impact       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `jquery` (~87KB)       | Bundle size reduction | 1 fewer HTTP request |
| `underscore` (~16KB)   | Bundle size reduction | 1 fewer HTTP request |
| `font-awesome` (~75KB) | CSS size reduction    | 1 fewer HTTP request |
| `animate.css` (~56KB)  | CSS size reduction    | 1 fewer HTTP request |
| `moment` (~56KB)       | Bundle size reduction | 1 fewer HTTP request |
| `lodash` (~70KB)       | Bundle size reduction | 1 fewer HTTP request |
| `axios` (~13KB)        | Bundle size reduction | 1 fewer HTTP request |

#### Performance Benefits

- **Zero External CDN Requests**: All libraries now bundled via Vite (was 12 CDN requests)
- **Faster Initial Load**: No external dependency fetching, optimized bundle
- **Better Caching**: Single bundled file with proper cache headers
- **Tree Shaking**: Only used parts of libraries included in bundle
- **Code Splitting**: Vite optimizes loading with modern bundling techniques
- **Better Dependency Management**: All dependencies managed through npm
- **Improved Build Performance**: Consistent versioning and faster builds
- **Enhanced Security**: No reliance on external CDNs

### Notes

- All application functionality has been preserved
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Dependency cleanup focused on removing unused external libraries
- All remaining dependencies are actively used in the codebase

  - Added `.prettierrc` with standardized formatting rules
  - Added `.prettierignore` to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
  - Added npm scripts: `format`, `format:check`, `lint:fix`
  - Integrated Prettier as dev dependency

### Removed - Code Cleanup & Performance Optimization

#### JavaScript Functions Removed

**analytics.js**

- ❌ `trackUnusedMetric1()` - Generated unnecessary large arrays (1000 elements)
- ❌ `trackUnusedMetric2()` - Performed expensive mathematical calculations (10,000 iterations)
- ❌ `trackUnusedMetric3()` - Created unnecessary large objects (100 properties)
- ❌ `moment` import - Unused dependency import

**charts.js**

- ❌ `createUnusedChart1()` - Doughnut chart constructor never called

- ❌ `createUnusedComponent2()` - Unused component factory function
- ❌ `createUnusedComponent3()` - Unused component factory function

- ❌ `pn7q2r()` - Created objects with 100 key-value pairs for no purpose
- ❌ `vb5x8w()` - Performed 10,000 expensive mathematical operations
- ❌ `TEMP_CONSTANT_1`, `TEMP_CONSTANT_2`, `TEMP_CONSTANT_3` - Unused constant exports

**main.js**

- ❌ `xk9m2p()` - Function that only logged and returned unused value
- ❌ `qr7n4v()` - Unused array operations (map, filter, reduce)
- ❌ `zt5w8h()` - Created object with 5 properties that was never used

#### CSS Styles Removed

**utilities.css** - Major Reduction

### Changed

- **Code Formatting**: All JavaScript and CSS files reformatted with Prettier
- **Import Optimization**: Removed unused `moment` import from analytics.js
- **Bundle Size**: Significantly reduced bundle size through dead code elimination

### Performance Impact

#### File Size Reductions

| File            | Before             | After    | Reduction            |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------------------- |
| `utilities.css` | 826 lines          | 41 lines | 95%                  |
| `analytics.js`  | ~100 lines removed | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `charts.js`     | ~60 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `components.js` | ~20 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `utils.js`      | ~30 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `main.js`       | ~25 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |

#### Performance Benefits

- **Reduced JavaScript Bundle Size**: Smaller bundles mean faster parsing and compilation
- **Reduced CSS Bundle Size**: Faster download and parsing times
- **Lower Memory Usage**: No unused function objects or style definitions in memory
- **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with only active code
- **Better Tree Shaking**: Easier for bundlers to identify and eliminate dead code

### Technical Details

#### Prettier Configuration

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

#### Cleanup Methodology

1. **Dead Code Analysis**: Searched for function calls and class usage across the entire codebase
2. **Import Optimization**: Verified all imports are actually used
3. **CSS Usage Verification**: Checked HTML and JavaScript for class references
4. **Conservative Approach**: Only removed code that was definitively unused
5. **Functionality Preservation**: Ensured all working features remain intact

### Notes

- All application functionality has been preserved
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Code cleanup focused on performance optimization through dead code elimination
- All changes are backwards compatible
