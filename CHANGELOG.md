## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-21 - Code Cleanup & Performance Optimization

### Added

- **Prettier Configuration**: Added Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - Added `.prettierrc` with standardized formatting rules
  - Added `.prettierignore` to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
  - Added npm scripts: `format`, `format:check`, `lint:fix`
  - Integrated Prettier as dev dependency

### Removed - Code Cleanup & Performance Optimization

#### JavaScript Functions Removed

**analytics.js**

- ❌ `trackUnusedMetric1()` - Generated unnecessary large arrays (1000 elements)
- ❌ `trackUnusedMetric2()` - Performed expensive mathematical calculations (10,000 iterations)
- ❌ `trackUnusedMetric3()` - Created unnecessary large objects (100 properties)
- ❌ `moment` import - Unused dependency import

**charts.js**

- ❌ `createUnusedChart1()` - Doughnut chart constructor never called
- ❌ `createUnusedChart2()` - Polar area chart constructor never called
- ❌ `createUnusedChart3()` - Bubble chart constructor never called

**components.js**

- ❌ `createUnusedComponent1()` - Unused component factory function
- ❌ `createUnusedComponent2()` - Unused component factory function
- ❌ `createUnusedComponent3()` - Unused component factory function

**utils.js**

- ❌ `jh3k9m()` - Generated large filtered/mapped arrays unnecessarily
- ❌ `pn7q2r()` - Created objects with 100 key-value pairs for no purpose
- ❌ `vb5x8w()` - Performed 10,000 expensive mathematical operations
- ❌ `TEMP_CONSTANT_1`, `TEMP_CONSTANT_2`, `TEMP_CONSTANT_3` - Unused constant exports

**main.js**

- ❌ `xk9m2p()` - Function that only logged and returned unused value
- ❌ `qr7n4v()` - Unused array operations (map, filter, reduce)
- ❌ `zt5w8h()` - Created object with 5 properties that was never used

#### CSS Styles Removed

**utilities.css** - Major Reduction

- **Before**: 826 lines of utility classes
- **After**: 41 lines of essential utilities only
- **Reduction**: 95% file size reduction
- ❌ Removed unused spacing utilities (margin/padding variants)
- ❌ Removed unused color utilities (text/background color classes)
- ❌ Removed unused border utilities (border styles, radius, colors)
- ❌ Removed unused position utilities (positioning classes)
- ❌ Removed unused size utilities (width/height percentages)
- ❌ Removed unused overflow utilities
- ❌ Removed unused shadow utilities
- ❌ Removed random styled utility classes (`rt8k4m`, `sq2n7p`, `uv5x9w`)
- ❌ Removed complex utility combinations with animations
- ✅ Kept essential utilities: `d-none`, `d-block`, `d-flex`, `text-center`, `text-left`, `text-right`, `m-0`, `p-0`, `w-100`, `justify-center`, `align-center`

**main.css**

- ❌ `.xk9m2p` - Unused gradient background class
- ❌ `.qr7n4v` - Unused dashed border class
- ❌ `.zt5w8h` - Unused striped background class
- ❌ `.complex-animation` - Unused animation class with keyframes
- ❌ Complex keyframe animation `complexKeyframe` - Never referenced
- ❌ Overly specific selector chains that were never used
- ❌ Duplicate `.user-card` definitions

**components.css**

- ❌ `.jh3k9m` - Unused gradient component class
- ❌ `.pn7q2r` - Unused bordered component class
- ❌ `.vb5x8w` - Unused striped component class
- ❌ `.yt9k4m` - Unused clipped polygon component class
- ❌ `.wq2n7p` - Unused radial gradient component class

### Changed

- **Code Formatting**: All JavaScript and CSS files reformatted with Prettier
- **Import Optimization**: Removed unused `moment` import from analytics.js
- **Bundle Size**: Significantly reduced bundle size through dead code elimination

### Performance Impact

#### File Size Reductions

| File            | Before             | After    | Reduction            |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------------------- |
| `utilities.css` | 826 lines          | 41 lines | 95%                  |
| `analytics.js`  | ~100 lines removed | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `charts.js`     | ~60 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `components.js` | ~20 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `utils.js`      | ~30 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |
| `main.js`       | ~25 lines removed  | -        | Dead code eliminated |

#### Performance Benefits

- **Reduced JavaScript Bundle Size**: Smaller bundles mean faster parsing and compilation
- **Reduced CSS Bundle Size**: Faster download and parsing times
- **Lower Memory Usage**: No unused function objects or style definitions in memory
- **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with only active code
- **Better Tree Shaking**: Easier for bundlers to identify and eliminate dead code

### Technical Details

#### Prettier Configuration

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

#### Cleanup Methodology

1. **Dead Code Analysis**: Searched for function calls and class usage across the entire codebase
2. **Import Optimization**: Verified all imports are actually used
3. **CSS Usage Verification**: Checked HTML and JavaScript for class references
4. **Conservative Approach**: Only removed code that was definitively unused
5. **Functionality Preservation**: Ensured all working features remain intact

### Notes

- All application functionality has been preserved
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Code cleanup focused on performance optimization through dead code elimination
- All changes are backwards compatible
